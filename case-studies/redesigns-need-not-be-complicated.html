            <!-- Hero Image -->

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Responsive design involves building experiences to work regardless of the size of a device's screen. Designing and building digital experiences with mobile in mind first is a healthy mindset, especially as it's the primary way people access the Web now, but one shouldn't design only for mobile. I learned this while redesigning for the non-profit organization known as Utah Girls Love You (or U.G.L.Y.'s for short).</p>
            <p>This organization has done amazing things for single parents across the state of Utah, as well as others throughout its communities. While the foundation's Website provides a fair amount of helpful information, it could use some improvements to make it more effective in furthering its noble mission. As a Web Design & Development student, I decided to implement such improvements on a test Website for educational purposes, and perhaps to recommend later to the maintainers of the actual Website.</p>

            <!-- images -->

            <p>In the interest of time, I started with the low-hanging fruit by focusing on design fixes that wouldn't be resource-intensive.</p>
            
            <h2>The Improvements</h2>
            <p>One example of a design issue I addressed was the navigation, which is always hidden behind a hamburger menu button on the current Website, even when viewing it on tablet and desktop devices. This not only wastes the space that could have been dedicated to the menu items on larger screens, it also means the user has to click on the button to access the menu links all the time, which is somewhat inconvenient for tablet and desktop users. I fixed this issue in the redesign by setting up the CSS so the menu displays its items horizontally with large viewports, while maintaining the hamburger menu on small screens.</p>

            <!-- images -->

            <p>Another design issue was the body text is a serif typeface (Adobe Caslon Pro). It works well in print, but sans serif is easier to read on screens. In the redesign, I replaced the old typeface for both the header and body text with Montserrat, a sans-serif font family with high legibility at both large and small sizes.</p>

            <!-- images -->

            <p>The last major design issue I addressed was the site's logo. Besides being pixelated, the text is hard to read because it's small and in a sort of display typeface. The logo also has an opaque background behind it, which I'm guessing was not intentional. To fix this, I created a new vector logo with a transparent background and larger, sans serif text.</p>

            <!-- images -->

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Through this project, I learned that even Websites that are mostly designed well can be significantly improved through small adjustments. The project also strengthened my belief that it is important to build a Website (or any product or experience) with the audience always in mind, regardless of the device they use.</p>
