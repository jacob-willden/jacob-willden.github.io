            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Social media can be a highly effective way to share experiences and ideas, for better or worse. Creating a number of posts for Instagram provided me an opportunity to explore using different kinds of visual media for the digital world. I centered my posts around California theme parks, specifically about how even the most seemingly ordinary parts of the resorts can positively impact the experience. I chose this topic for a number of reasons, including my love for theme parks, and that I was able to get the photos a while ago (which is important for me because personal circumstances prevent most travel for me right now, and I had already taken a photography class before, so I was able to get some good shots). The ideas I had for the posts were as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Still Image of Disneyland Character Anecdote - The post text will relate a funny story I saw while in Disneyland, involving Pluto and a plushie of Dale the Chipmunk, with the post image being a photo I took while it was happening.</li>
                <li>Slideshow of Miniland USA - Arguably the coolest part of Legoland, this post will have a slideshow of some of the amazing builds from this area of the park.</li>
                <li>Slow Motion Shot of Waterfall - This is of one of the waterfalls from the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage ride, captured using the iPhone camera's slow motion feature.</li>
                <li>Picture Quote with Walt Disney Silhouette - A sunset shot where the Walt Disney Statue can be seen over the trees will from a famous quote about Walt's vision, such as: "If you can dream it, you can do it."</li>
                <li>Park Goers Meme - A meme that contrasts the expectation versus the reality of what most of your day at a theme park is like (e.g. waiting in line).</li>
                <li>Video of Lighting Effects in the Space Mountain Queue - In one section of the line for Space Mountain, light patterns come through faux windows to create the illusion of traveling through space, which is captured in this video. Even before getting on the ride, theme parks can easily transport you to another place using uncomplicated effects.</li>
                <li>Collage of Disney Park Artists Live at Work - There are a couple of places at Disneyland Resort where you can see artists drawing stills or animations of beloved Disney characters, and it's a delight to see their fantastic work in action (really, all the cast members/employees play valuable roles in the parks). This post will be a multiple picture layout of these artists in action.</li>
                <li class="no-padding">Question for Followers - To create some discussion, hopefully civil, I'll ask my theoretical followers (as I most certainly won't have any yet) what their favorite amusement park is and why, which will not be limited to California.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Fun and Difficulties of Posting</h2>
            <p>I thought of the Question for Followers post because I was really only able to create content for Disneyland and Legoland, which are only a couple of resorts in California. This post was meant to give a chance for theoretical discussion about the other parks. If I end up creating further posts, I will make them about the other parks as well. While creating this post, I ran into a technical issue where I couldn't see the post on other devices or accounts. This was apparently because I tried to create the post using the poll sticker with the Stories feature, which is known to be highly buggy. So I decided to put the question as just text over an image. This had the added benefit of allowing more choices from the followers, since the poll sticker only allows for 2 answers (which meant I had to originally go for "Disney" or "Other Parks" to help get the followers talking with each other).</p>

                    <img src="../images/instagram/Quote.jpg" alt='A silhouette of the "Partners" statue in Disneyland, overlayed by a quote from Walt Disney that reads, "If you can dream it, you can do it."' loading="lazy">

                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>I took the background photograph for the Picture Quote with Walt Disney Silhouette post originally just because I thought it was a good-looking picture, but I realized that since it depicted a statue of Walt Disney pointing in the distance, it could easily be combined with a quote of his that could be associated with the park. I decided on the quote: "If you can dream it, you can do it. Always remember that this whole thing was started with a dream and a mouse." From there, it was simply a matter of aligning the text and the image to get an appealing composition (using the rule of thirds). While posting the image however, I ran into a vague error stating, "Not posted yet. Try again." After doing some troubleshooting, including restarting my device, I discovered that the image had been saved as a PNG instead of a JPEG. Personally, I wish the Instagram interface would have stated that the file format was incorrect rather than just giving an ambiguous error message, but it was a good learning experience.</p>

            <div class="figure-container">

                    <img src="../images/instagram/Meme.jpg" alt="Various drafts of a meme that contrasts the expectation of Disney Parks being the most amazing experience in the world with the reality of so much of the time in the Parks being spent waiting in lines." loading="lazy">

                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>To make sure that the images were sized and cropped properly (so they wouldn't appear pixelated or have black bars on the sides), I checked the resolution and aspect ratios of each image/video, or collection of images that are put together in a post. With the Meme post for example, I started with a canvas that was the maximum allowed resolution for Instagram (1936 x 1936 pixels) and then inserted and cropped the images and text so they would fit, while having some white space around them so the images would not be up against the edge.</p>
            <p>For the Slideshow post, I chose photos of Miniland USA that could all have the same aspect ratio upon cropping them. There were a number of images I thought of using, but they did not work well with the other images because they had compositions that made it so they would need to be cropped differently, so I decided not to use them.</p>

            <div class="figure-container">
                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/instagram/Collage.jpg" alt="Photos of animators drawing sketches of Disney characters being overlapped with a photo of a wall depiciting Pixar movie storyboards, in an image editor." loading="lazy">
                    <figcaption>Overlapping various photos to create the Collage post.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>The Collage post involved putting 5 images on the same square canvas, also the maximum resolution for Instagram, and experimenting with overlapping and cropping the images until they all complimented each other in a visually pleasing way.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>One of the lessons I learned during this project is to pay attention to the file formats you are using. For example, it was a good idea to originally save the images as PNGs while I was editing them to make sure the image quality would not be degraded from compression, but I needed to convert them to JPEG in the end so they could work with Instagram. Another lesson I learned was that images can be effectively communicated with a variety of aspect ratios, whether square, 4:3. 16:9, or another ratio. Finally, I learned that even small posts take a significant amount of planning and work to get right. It gives me greater appreciation for those who post well-crafted content regularly.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, this project has been a great opportunity for me to dive into using social media more and learn more about the technology that's involved. I certainly would never want to become an influencer, but it's cool to see and contribute content. Done right, social media can be a great opportunity to connect with those around us whom we can't otherwise meet, and Instagram is a great example of that.</p>
