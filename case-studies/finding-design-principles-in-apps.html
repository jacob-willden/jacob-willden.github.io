            <h1>Finding Design Principles in Apps and Why It Matters</h1>

            <!-- Hero Image -->

            <p>When working as either a designer or developer for digital experiences, it's important to be familiar with various design principles that help create the best designs possible. To help you better implement these principles, you can learn from other people's work by searching for design principles present in the digital experiences others build.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite mobile apps is VidAngel, which allows one to watch movies and TV shows without inappropriate content such as profanity, sexuality, violence, substance abuse, and cultural insensitivity, based on one's personal preferences (as long as one has legal access to the movies or TV shows through streaming services such as Netflix). I decided to identify some of the clearest design principles at play in the app, and how they make the app as great as it is. The 5 most prominent ones I found were Navigation, Iconography, Color and Text Legibility, Mapping, and Nudging. All of these principles can be found in the book Universal Principles of Design by William Lidwell, Kritina Holden, and Jill Butler (published October 1st, 2003).</p>

            <p>This also provided a great opportunity for me to create documentation, which is a vital skill in the technology industry. Each page, dedicated to a design principle, includes a screenshot portrayed on a device to put it in context, as well as indicators pointing to various parts of the interface with commentary describing how they illustrate the principle.</p>

            <h2>The Principles in Action</h2>
            <p>As far as Navigation goes, the app utilizes menus to allow users to intuit how to get to the content they want and to tailor settings to their own liking. The combinations of icons and labels make the functions of the buttons clear and succinct. It would be easy to integrate navigation like this into other designs, and knowing how these buttons are used makes structuring the app (information architecture) straightforward from a development standpoint.</p>
            <p>Next we have Iconography. VidAngel uses icons that help their customers quickly glean through content without having to click on each title, resulting in a more efficient and pleasant experience. Icons like these could absolutely be adapted to other designs. Developers can benefit from knowing where and when they c used so they can format them properly (e.g. correct icon resolution so they aren't pixelated).</p>
            <p>Color and Text Legibility is prominent in the app, with copy that contrasts well with backgrounds, which makes everything easier to read. The use of good contrast is universally applicable, and following such guidelines is essential to good design.</p>
            <p>Then there's Mapping. The app utilizes the design principle of mapping by having logical responses to touch gestures. The design guideline of navigation is aided by mapping in that scrolling vertically or horizontally allows one to look through the various titles in the VidAngel library. This standard use of mapping is in harmony with Jakob's law, meaning that the mapping matches the user's expectations because it's implemented similarly to other apps. It's so intuitive that customers don't even need to think about it, and would work in any similar design.</p>
            <p>Finally, the process of Nudging means creating a favorable path of least resistance for the user. One nudging technique is creating "structured choices", which makes it easier for one to look through all the options without being overwhelmed. Structured choices are communicated through the form of dropdown menus in a way that's straightforward due to its use of indentation for the menu items and of the expand/collapse arrow for each menu (which is a category of filters). The Filters menu uses chunking by splitting the various filter options into categories, which also makes it easy to understand.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This exercise proved highly insightful as I realized how much effort is put into designing an app that's both visually pleasing and easy to use, and started thinking of how to integrate the above design principles and others into my own designs in the future. It also provided an opportunity for me to develop my documentation skills, which I have been using ever since. I would definitely recommend this exercise to anyone who is looking into Web design and/or Web development.</p>
