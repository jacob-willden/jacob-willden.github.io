            <h1>User Research Comes First</h1>

            <!-- Hero Image -->

            <p>While most designers and developers apparently don't like hearing it, we need to prioritize user testing to create the best digital experiences possible. I learned this from practical experience while working on a team to create a new Website design for the Engineering Technology department at Utah Valley University (UVU) to increase student enrollment. My role in the team regularly changed from leader to supporter and vice-versa.</p>

            <h2>Why Redesign in the First Place?</h2>
            <p>The Engineering Technology department had struggled with underwhelming student numbers, mostly because very few people knew about what the department's programs have to offer. One of the primary reasons for this was that students were only hearing about the programs through word of mouth. While the department had a Website, it was disorganized and hard to use as of 2022. Our goal was to attract more students into the Engineering Technology programs to help them get better jobs and lives. Our deadline was 5 months after receiving the project.</p>

            <h2>Planning & Discovery</h2>
            <p>Our project began by interviewing our client. We found out that graduating students enter an industry with 100% job placement, lots of lucrative career options, and no gender wage gap. That's a fantastic value proposition on its own, but the department also provides scholarships to make the program's low costs even lower. Despite all of this, the program classes were well below capacity. One of the reasons for this was their Website had some design issues, including unclear organization, important information missing, and out-of-date news & events.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>To start getting quantitative data about potential users, we created and distributed a survey with demographic, education, and interest questions. Then we performed interviews with a handful of people of our target audience. Finally, we created provisional personas as representations of our target groups to create empathy and remind ourselves for whom we would be redesigning.</p>

            <h2>Primary Audience</h2>
            <p>Our client told us that most students who join the department's two programs are individuals already in the workforce who are seeking better pay. With the redesign, the Website could help attract younger students. Therefore, high school and new college students became our main target audience.</p>

            <!-- images -->

            <h2>Audience Surveys</h2>
            <p>In addition to asking about preference between an Associate's or Bachelor's degree, we asked if they would be interested in a weekend class (since the two programs are offered in a weekend cohort format), if they're interested in starting or going back to college, and if they have interest in robots. The majority were not interested in weekend classes, most responded positively to the college question, and only a few said they were interested in robots.</p>

            <!-- images -->

            <h2>Audience Interviews</h2>
            <p>Some of the findings we obtained from interviewing a handful of our survey participants included that job security is more important to them than salary, the accelerated pace of the shorter programs would work if the students are sufficiently motivated, there's a social stigma against Associate's degrees even if they provide equal pay to a Bachelor's, and weekend classes don't work for many people because of their schedules.</p>

            <h2>Eye-Tracking Tests</h2>
            <p>To test our assumptions about the Engineering Technology's current Website, we conducted tests using eye-tracking technology to find out where users' eyes go when moving through the Website. The tasks were as follows:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Find where you would receive more information for scholarships</li>
                <li>Find the Mechatronics advisor</li>
                <li>Find the section for Associate of Applied Science (AAS) in the Automation & Electrical Technology degree</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Surprising Reality of Degree Length</h2>
            <p>While the belief that more education equals more money is often true, it really depends on the major and job in question. One of the majors the Engineering Technology department offers, Automation & Electrical Technology, is a two year program (Associate's degree), while the other, Mechatronics, is a four year program (Bachelor's degree). Though it may be difficult to believe, the jobs resulting from both degrees provide practically the same average payment, which means that the former is more lucrative for the amount of education. As expected from our user interviews, this is contrary to social expectations, where Bachelor's degrees were highly favored over Associate's degrees because the former was considered more valuable and lucrative.</p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>With the data we obtained from our survey and interviews, we created a design brief outlining our personas, guiding design principles, our results from the survey and interviews, and design comparisons with other colleges/institutions offering similar programs to Engineering Technology's programs. This allowed us to get feedback from our client to ensure we were heading in the right direction. We then started on creating the redesign.</p>
            <p>It's worth noting that only at this point that we actually started the actual redesign of the Website. This was done on purpose to ensure that we had plenty of user data to work with.</p>

            <h2>Site Map</h2>
            <p>Organizing all the Website's information in a logical way was one of the most important parts of the redesign, so knowing what information goes where was essential. To accomplish this, we created a site map to represent all the Website pages and outlines of their content. We learned that we could remove an item from the Website's navigation, namely for the Machine Shop, since it could already be accessed from the Student Resources page and would only be used by those who are already students in one of the department's programs.</p>

            <!-- images -->

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>With the site map completed, we knew what information should go on which page, but we still had to figure out how the information would be arranged on each page. That's where wireframes came in. We initially created them separately, but we didn't agree on a set size for the pages, so the spacing and look of the page headers and footers were inconsistent, an issue we fixed in a second iteration.</p>
            
            <!-- images -->

            <h2>Surface Compositions</h2>
            <p>Our wireframes were mostly high-fidelity already, so creating surface compositions from them mostly consisted of inserting the actual fonts, colors, and images. Having the same fonts and colors as the rest of Utah Valley University's Website was out of necessity to work with the Website's Content Management System (CMS), and helped to fulfill our guiding design principle of consistency.</p>

            <!-- images -->

            <h2>Testing & Validating</h2>
            <p>With our surface compositions in place, it was time to see if the redesign was actually more effective in helping students learn more about and apply for either of the two programs. This meant converting the surface comps into a prototype and testing it with potential users. For the prototype tests, we had our users complete the same tasks we used for the eye-tracking tests with the old Website.</p>

            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <p>To know how navigating across the redesigned site, we created a prototype that allows one to move from one page to another as if it were a real Website. One thing we learned was that advising was difficult to find for 4 of the subjects that were not already familiar with the UVU Website, so we added an additional, visual link on the homepage to make it easier to locate. We added a link at the bottom of the Faculty & Staff page as well.</p>
            <p>Another thing we learned is that the organization of our redesigned Website made it easier to navigate than the current Website (for example, scholarships can be accessed directly from the homepage). We found this out by comparing our prototype tests with tests we did earlier in the semester with the current site.</p>
            <p>At least one of our test subjects expressed potential interest in the program.</p>

            <h2>Project Retrospective</h2>
            <p>This project was a great experience for me to work through the design process for a Website from beginning to end. My team was able to coordinate well most of the time, and we learned from our mistakes and created better and better iterations of our design work. Next time, I'll try to communicate more with my team to ensure we're all on the same page (which I learned to be highly important when creating the wireframes). Our client was pleased with the result, and once the designs are implemented, the Engineering Technology program can likely expect an increase in student count.</p>
            <p>For a while, I was skeptical of spending so much time on collecting audience information before designing, but I know that our design was all the better for it. This process is likewise helpful in the workplace, as it ensures that the users come first in the design. And that's what we as designers and developers want, right?</p>
