            <h2>Eagerly Building the Web, One Page at a Time</h2>
            <p>My name is Jacob Willden, and I'm a student in Web Design & Development, Web & App Development Emphasis, at Utah Valley University. I'm fascinated by the World Wide Web and its countless applications, and I love helping to build it. Accessibility is a big passion of mine, and I'm continually learning how to make sure that the experiences I build are usable for as many people as possible.</p>
            <p>My current educational goals include learning effective front-end and back-end development for Web and other digital experiences. At this point, I have many of the basics of languages such as HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript, but I want to learn about various frameworks and libraries built on these languages for more advanced Web development. I also would like to learn better ways to coordinate with designers to deliver the greatest user experiences possible.</p>
            <p>When I enter the workforce, I'm going to keep learning, as anyone in the technology field should. I don't know where I'm going to work yet, but I want to bring genuine value to the company I work for, starting as a junior Web developer. It's an exciting industry, and I can hardly wait to enter it.</p>
            <p>In the long-term, I plan to promote best practices to allow the best experiences possible for whoever uses the Web and app experiences I'm involved in. Whether my expertise will become more broad or more specific, I don't know, but learning will always be a part of what I do. My goal is becoming the best I can be.</p>
